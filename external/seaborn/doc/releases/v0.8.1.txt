v0.8.1 (September 2017)
-----------------------

- Added a warning in :class:`FacetGrid` when passing a categorical plot function without specifying ``order`` (or ``hue_order`` when ``hue`` is used), which is likely to produce a plot that is incorrect.

- Improved compatibility between :class:`FacetGrid` or :class:`PairGrid` and interactive matplotlib backends so that the legend no longer remains inside the figure when using ``legend_out=True``.

- Changed categorical plot functions with small plot elements to use :func:`dark_palette` instead of :func:`light_palette` when generating a sequential palette from a specified color.

- Improved robustness of :func:`kdeplot` and :func:`distplot` to data with fewer than two observations.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`clustermap` when using ``yticklabels=False``.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`pointplot` where colors were wrong if exactly three points were being drawn.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`pointplot` where legend entries for missing data appeared with empty markers.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`clustermap` where an error was raised when annotating the main heatmap and showing category colors.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`clustermap` where row labels were not being properly rotated when they overlapped.

- Fixed a bug in :func:`kdeplot` where the maximum limit on the density axes was not being updated when multiple densities were drawn.

- Improved compatibility with future versions of pandas.
